# souvik-appointment-booking-app
I made this appointment booking app with jwt authentication for both user and admin accounts. I have implemented protected routes in this project which limits pages based on the person logging it (whether it is a auser or an admin). The users can make a booking and also delete it to make another booking. The admin can see the bookings of all the users.
